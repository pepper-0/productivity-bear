discord app to set reminders and keep you productive... instead of yapping away

### meet quinoa, your productivity companion!
productivity bear is a Discord bot meant to help you keep yourself productive, especially if you often find yourself hanging out on Discord a lot. he has a couple of basic features to help you do so:
- **/remindme**: allows you to schedule a time for quinoa to dm you with a specific message, such as a reminder to do something. 
- **/motivateme**: sends a motivational quote and some encouragement to get some work done!
- **/setcheckin**: allows you to schedule periodic dm's to check in on how you're doing. 

### whats up with quinoa?

- my last project for the athena award! definitely not cramming this in the last week it's due.. 
recently i've been using discord a lot more for various reasons (programs, communicating for organizations, etc) and so i tend to have the tab open a lot. add that with dming people on it pretty often... and you get a chronically online person that is NOT working on her college apps!! so, i thought it'd be fun to have a bear friend that could remind me to stay locked instead of checking my messages.

### what's quinoa made with?
- i used the Discord API for Python; this was my first time so it was definitely a bit of a struggle to understand! i have a baseline understanding of Python and some experience with OOP/GUI/event listening from Java and JavaScript so that definitely made things a little less daunting. overall, i wouldn't say i was able to learn too much about the Discord API as a whole but i could still understand what i was coding. but i'm totally interested in adding more features to productivity bear or doing more with the Discord API! also, i KEEP using semicolons and brackets. it's been a minute since ive actually coded in python (BWSI shenanigans but lowk i think our whole class vibecoded, including myself. and a bit with code in place but before that was like 2.5 years ago in an introductory programming class lols. i digress.)
